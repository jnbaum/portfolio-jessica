    <p> I'm Jessica, a soon-to-be graduate with a Master of Science in Software Engineering, a deep curiosity for solving real-world problems with code, and a drive to keep learning long after the classwork ends.
    From cloud systems and database design to front-end development and game mechanics, my work blends technical skill with creativity. I’m always anchored in thoughtful design and purposeful functionality.
    Here you’ll find here a curated selection of my work, from academic and personal software projects to creative endeavors outside of tech. Feel free to explore, or connect with me directly.</p>
